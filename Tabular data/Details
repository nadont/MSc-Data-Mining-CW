Intelligent Data and Text Analytics Coursework 1
Download the 2011 UK Census dataset from the IDTA module page on Moodle.
1. [20%] Descriptive analytics:
a. [10%] Display and interpret basic statistics for all attributes
b. [10%] Display and interpret 5 visualisation graphs; include one box plot and four
visualisations that show relationships between 2 or more variables
2. [20%] Perform classification for the “Approximate Social Grade” attribute using 3 algorithms;
present and discuss the results; compare the results of the 3 algorithms.
3. [20%] Perform regression on the “No of hours” attribute using 2 algorithms; present and
discuss the results; compare the results of the 2 algorithms.
4. [20%] Perform association rule mining using 1 algorithm and interpret the meaning of at least
5 rules.
5. [20%] Perform clustering using 2 algorithms; present and discuss the results; compare the
results of the 2 algorithms.
The marking scheme [in 100% breakup of marks] for each of the tasks is as follows:
20% - Display of results
40% - Analysis of results
20% - Use of tables and figures when reporting the results to facilitate understanding
10% - Organisation, language style and clarity
10% - The use of at least one method/algorithm not covered in the teaching sessions in
addition to the number of methods/algorithms mentioned in the tasks; for
example, for Task 1, 5 visualisations are required; to get this 10% you need to
include at least one more visualisation that was not covered in addition to the
required 5.
