1. [30%] Preprocess the textual data to remove potential noise. Use, as a minimum, the
following preprocessing methods: 1) removing punctuation, 2) removing numbers, 3)
removing stop words, 4) changing the text to lower/upper case and 5) lemmatising.
Describe in detail, with examples, the changes to the text for each preprocessing method
applied.
2. [30%] Using the bag-of-words/terms representation, perform classification using 3
algorithms; present and discuss the results; compare the results of the 3 algorithms.
3. [10%] Perform classification using a BERT-based model with fine-tuning and compare the
results with the 3 algorithms from Task 2.
4. [30%] Perform topic detection using 1 algorithm; present and discuss each topic, and assess
the quality of the detected topics.
The marking scheme [in 100% breakup of marks] for each of the tasks is as follows:
20% - Display of results
40% - Analysis of results
20% - Use of tables and figures when reporting the results to facilitate understanding
10% - Organisation, language style and clarity
10% - The use of at least one method/algorithm not covered in the teaching sessions in
addition to the number of methods/algorithms mentioned in the tasks; for example,
for Task 1, 5 preprocessing methods are required; to get this 10% you need to
include at least one more preprocessing method that was not covered in addition
to the required 5.
